# Power calculation for comparing logistic dose-response curves (powdrc)

This tool allows to estimate the sample size of a comparative 1:1 two-arm prospective tumour-control assay based on comparing logistic regression curves of the two arms. It implements a Monte-Carlo simulation that repeatedly performs experiments on simulated individuals according to estimated parameters. The simulation can handle the creation of heterogeneous arms, e.g., combining several xenografts of different treatment sensitivity. A graphical user interface as well as two scripted examples are available for testing and as templates. The examples are based on dose-response curves from animal irradiation.
